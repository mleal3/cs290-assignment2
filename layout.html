		<p>Leeroy Jenkins is easily the most recognizable name in all World of Warcraft. It isn't Thrall, it isn't Arthas, it isn't Chris Metzen or Ghostcrawler. It's Leeroy Jenkins. Leeroy has transcended the realm of geekdom in a way that no other aspect of World of Warcraft can. Although I was never able to play as many hours as most of my friends, I was always intrigued with Mr. Jenkins. His name suits him well. While World of Warcraft may have made appearances in shows such as Stargate Atlantis, Leeroy has found a place on How I Met Your Mother, My Name is Earl, Scrubs, and beyond -- he has become a genre and a trope unto himself. Leeroy Jenkins has been mentioned and plugged so many times in pop culture that the days of his being a World of Warcraft reference are in decline and we're coming to a point that most of the world has no idea of the origin of the joke.</p>

		<p> It's just a funny thing that exists, disembodied from its nerdy, video game roots. So who is this Leeroy Jenkins fellow, and why is he so gosh-darn funny? Sociologists have spent countless hours trying to determine precisely why the Leeroy joke is so funny to people on such a large scale, when many of those people may not even understand the minutiae of the gag. I'll take care of it for you, guys: People love seeing other people do dumb things, especially when there's an element of surprise. Since 2005, many viewers of the video have questioned its authenticity. Was it real? Was it staged? Leeroy spent years leaving fans in the dark about that, stating it was more fun to leave people guessing, but come on. Come on. Of course it's staged, you dweebs. That doesn't make it any less entertaining.</p>
